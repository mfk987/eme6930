                <p>Melissa cultivated her love of the outdoors and environmental science at Berry College's 24,000+ acre campus in northwest Georgia. With opportunities to monitor groundwater levels for over one year, study man-made lake restoration, gather soil samples from local caves, study stream flow and brownfield restoration Melissa gained years of hands-on field experience.</p>
                <p>In the Summer of 2008, Melissa was able to study abroad in Iceland for two weeks and see many of the geologic features from textbooks in real life. The highlight of the trip was walking on a glacier, then visiting the black sand beaches and ending the day visiting a thermal hot sping to relax.</p>
